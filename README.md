Assignment: Submitted the assignment on OOD principles, Class Diagrams, Object Diagrams, and Sequence Diagrams.

## 07/02/25
## Topics Covered:

Inheritance in Java:
Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another, promoting code reusability.

Single Level Inheritance:
A class inherits directly from one superclass.

Multilevel Inheritance:
A class inherits from another class, forming a chain of inheritance.

Hierarchical Inheritance:
Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.

Key Features of Inheritance
Code Reusability: Subclasses reuse code from superclasses.
Method Overriding: Subclasses can change the behavior of superclass methods.
Extensibility: New functionality can be added through subclassing.
Method Overriding:
Subclasses provide their own implementation of superclass methods.

Constructor Inheritance in Java:  
Constructors are not inherited, but a subclass can call the superclass constructor using super().

Polymorphism and Inheritance: 
Polymorphism allows subclasses to override superclass methods, enabling dynamic method calls.

Access Modifiers and Inheritance
Access modifiers (public, private, protected, default) control visibility of superclass members in subclasses.
Assignment: - Inheritance, Single Level Inheritance, Multilevel Inheritance, Hierarchical Inheritance, Key Features of Inheritance, Method Overriding, Constructor Inheritance in Java, Polymorphism and Inheritance, Access Modifiers and Inheritance.
